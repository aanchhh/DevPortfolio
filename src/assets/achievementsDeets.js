    "The hackathon was an incredibly fun and high-energy experience. There was a unique thrill in collaborating closely as a team, brainstorming creative solutions on the fly, and bringing a critical safety application like Neerja to life from just an idea to a working prototype in such a short, focused period.",
    "The intense, deadline-driven environment was a catalyst for my personal growth. It pushed me to rapidly apply theoretical knowledge, make quick decisions, and build a complete end-to-end application under pressure. This hands-on challenge significantly sharpened my problem-solving abilities, coding efficiency, and my skills in integrating complex components like an AI model with a user-friendly interface.",
